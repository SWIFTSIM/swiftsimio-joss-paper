# Summary

`swiftsimio` is a python package for reading data created by the SWIFT [@SWIFT]
simulation code. SWIFT is designed to run cosmological hydrodynamics
simulations that produce petabytes of data, and `swiftsimio` leverages the
custom metadata that SWIFT produces to allow for chunked loading of the
particle data and to enable integration with `unyt` [@unyt].

# Background

Cosmological gallaxy formation simulations are used to track simulated galaxies
across cosmic time in an attempt to better understand the process of galaxy
formation and evolution. As time has progressed, so has the scale of these
simulations. The state-of-the-art simulations planned for the next decade,
using codes like SWIFT, will generate petabytes of data thanks to their use of
hundreds of billions of particles.  Analysing this data presents a unique
challenge, with the data reduction performed on either single compute nodes or
on individual desktop machines. 

In the original EAGLE simulation [@EAGLE], just the co-ordinates of the gas
particles in a single snapshot used 82 Gb of storage space. State-of-the-art
simulations are now using at least 10 times as many particles as this, making
an analysis pipeline that reads the whole array each time expensive in the best
case and infeasible in the worst. There are two useful properties of this data:
it is stored in the HDF5 format [@hdf5], allowing for easy slicing, and usually users
are interested in a very small sub-set of the data, usually less than 1%, at a
time.

This requirement to load less than 1% of the data at a time is primarily due to
the huge dynamic range present in these simulations [@dynamicRange]. Although
the simulation volume may be hundreds of megaparsecs on a side, the objects
that form under self-gravity are typically less than a few megaparsecs in
diameter, representing a very small proportion of the total volume. Users are
usually interested in using the particle data present in a few objects
(selected using pre-computed data in 'halo catalogues') at any given time.

# Structure of a SWIFT snapshot

At pre-determined times during a SWIFT simulation, a full particle dump is
performed. This particle dump is stored in the HDF5 format, with arrays
corresponding to different particle properties. The overall structure of the
file conforms to the Gadget-2 specification [@Gadget2]. This is to enable
compatibility with previous analysis pipelines.

The SWIFT snapshot files have main datasets called `PartType{0,1,2,3,4,5}`,
each with sub-datasets such as `Coordinates`, `Velocities`, etc.  that contain
the co-ordinates and velocities for particles of that type respectively. When the
file is opened in `swiftsimio`, this is translated to an object hierarchy, so that
for a user to access the co-ordinates of the gas particles they would use code
similar to:
```python
from swiftsimio import load

data = load("/path/to/snapshot.hdf5")
coordinates = data.gas.coordinates
```
where here `coordinates` is an `unyt` array containing the co-ordinates of all
of the gas particles in the file with appropriate units and cosmology information
attached. This data is loaded lazily, with an array only loaded from file when
it is requested for use by the user. This data is then cached for future use.

The table below shows what each particle type corresponds to and how it is
accessed in `swiftsimio`.

| Particle type | `swiftsimio` name | Description                               |
|:-------------:|:-----------------:|-------------------------------------------|
|       0       |       `gas`       | Gas particles, the only type of particles |
|               |                   | to have hydrodynamics calculations        |
|               |                   | performed on them.                        |
|       1       |   `dark_matter`   | Dark matter particles, only subject to    |
|               |                   | the force of gravity.                     |
|       2       |     `boundary`    | Boundary particles; the same as dark      |
|               |                   | matter but typically more massive.        |
|       3       | `second_boundary` | Boundary particles; the same as dark      |
|               |                   | matter but typically more massive.        |
|       4       |      `stars`      | Star particles representing either        |
|               |                   | individual stars or a stellar population. |
|       5       |   `black_holes`   | Black hole particles representing         |
|               |                   | individual black holes.                   |

# Solving the data reduction challenge

![Pictorial representation of the top-level grid in SWIFT. The background shows
the distribution of matter in the snapshot, with selected galaxies circled.
`swiftsimio` can load the data in the regions that these spheres overlap with,
only reading the appropriate particle data from file. Each coloured region
shows the top-level cells that would be loaded for the corresponding circled
galaxy.](figure.pdf)

To solve the dynamic range problem, we can turn to the spatial arrangement of
the particle data. Simulations in SWIFT are performed in a cuboid volume that
is split into a fixed number of top-level cells. When a snapshot of the
simulation is dumped, each array is written to disk top-level cell by top-level
cell, ensuring a well-characterised order. The order in which the data is
stored is then written as metadata in the `Cells` dataset in the snapshot file.
The `SWIFTMask` object within `swiftsimio` uses this metadata to provide a mask
to be used with the `h5py` library to read a sub-set of the particle data. This
process ensures that as little data is read from disk as possible.

The use of this masking functionality is unique to `swiftsimio` and allows for
significantly reduced memory footprint and cost relative to reading the full
snapshot. Other libraries, such as `yt` [@yt] offer similar functionality through
the creation of a hashtable on the first read of the snapshot, but our approach
requires no extra computation or files to achieve.

# Why swiftsimio?

There are many python libraries that are able to read the Gadget-style
formatted HDF5 data that SWIFT outputs, not limited to but including: `yt`
[@yt], `pynbody` [@pynbody] and `pnbody` [@pnbody]. The other option is simply
to use the `h5py` library directly, and forgo any extra processing of the data.

`swiftsimio` was created because these libraries either are too slow (usually
performing significant pre-calculation when loading a snapshot), provide too
weak of a connection to the data in the snapshot (e.g. reading the data in a
different order than it is stored in the file), or would have been unable to
integrate with the metadata that SWIFT outputs.  To make full use of the SWIFT
metadata all of these packages would have had to have significant re-writes of
their internals, which would have taken significantly more time (due to their
more complex codebases) or would have been unwelcome changes due to their
impact on the users of other simulation codes.

We can also ensure that `swiftsimio` remains updated and constantly in-sync
with the rapidly changing SWIFT code, as well as ensure that extra routines
that are part of the library (e.g. visualisation) use the same definitions and
functions that are implemented in the main simulation code.

Finally, `swiftsimio` includes many other features useful to users of the
SWIFT cosmological simulation code, such as parallel visualisation and
data repackaging.

The `swiftsimio` package will enable the next generation of cosmological
simulations, ran with SWIFT, to be analysed on substantially smaller machines
than were previously required with little extra effort from day-to-day users.
